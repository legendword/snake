# Snake
 A two-player snake game made by Legendword (outdated).

 This program is at least 4 years old, thus it's very outdated and not recommended for using.
 
 It uses the outdated Ljs, a Javascript library I created a few years ago to "simplify code", which has been abandoned by me.
 
 Overall a very simple two-player snake game where you try to win by hitting the head of your snake with the head of the other snake. You can eat the red squares (food) to grow in length. The longer you are, the slower you are. If you hit the body of the other snake (any part of the snake that's not the head, in other words, the leading square), you will "cut" their body from that point. The other snake will be shorter yet faster. Game ends when two heads meet, and whoever is longer wins. However, if two snakes are of same length when this check happens, the winning snake is the snake that first touches the other snake. This is a completely random and unfair solution to this conflict, and hasn't been fixed since I will be making a newer version of this game later.
